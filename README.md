# Text_MiningWk10
R code for CS909 week 10 text mining assignment

The code will take approximately 3 hours to run due to the complex multi iterations and running of classifiers that is required on the large corpus of data

the code is commented at each stage to identify what sections do what function and also the report has some examples of the outputs

The R code required to be loaded into a R script file and it is suggested that it is run in sections 
First section is the data preparation phase - up to the cross validation classification phase
The classification phase is the longest section to run 
The clustering phase was got limited results and was abandoned in R and transferred to WEKA
